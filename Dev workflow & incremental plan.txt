Dev workflow & incremental plan

Create a small Express server skeleton with route folders (auth, users, quizzes, courses, admin).
Add a Mongo connection utility and a simple GET /health route.
Implement mock routes returning static responses (so frontend can switch to API without DB first).
Implement auth (register/login) + token middleware.
Implement quiz endpoints + submit flow and persist to Mongo.
Implement leaderboard points accumulation (update points on quiz submit).
Implement progress endpoints and badge calculation.
Add tests and basic Swagger/OpenAPI doc for endpoints.
Deploy backend (e.g., Heroku/Render/Vercel serverless or DigitalOcean) and set VITE_API_BASE in frontend build.



Integration notes for frontend

Replace static arrays with fetch calls to endpoints above. Example:
On StudentDashboard mount: GET ${API_BASE}/users/me/progress, GET ${API_BASE}/leaderboard?period=week, GET ${API_BASE}/videos?subject=...
On Video click: use lesson.contentUrl returned by GET /lessons/:id
For quizzes: GET /quizzes/:id then POST /quizzes/:id/submit
Add a small client wrapper util (api.ts) that attaches Authorization header when token present and centralizes error handling.


Minimum viable endpoints to unblock frontend quickly (priority)

GET/api/subjects
GET/api/courses and GET/api/courses/:id)
GET/api/quizzes/:id
POST/api/quizzes/:id/submit
GET/api/leaderboard
GET/api/users/id or user?
GET/api/events
